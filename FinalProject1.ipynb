    "## Introduction & Problem Statement\n",
    "One of the most common wayside wheel load monitoring techniques employed in the rail industry is to mount chevron-style strain gauges to the crib section of the rail. The strains measured by these gauges are then related to applied wheel loads through rail material and geometric properties. Due to crosstalk between vertical and lateral load-induced strains, two separate strain circuits are employed; one for vertical load and one for lateral load. The vertical load circuit comprises four chevron-style strain gauges placed at the rail neutral axis to measure strains at ± 45º as shown in Figure 1. Two gauges are placed symmetrically about the crib center between the crib center and the face of adjacent crossties on each face of the rail web. The distance D is chosen such that the induced strains are not affected by the boundary effects of the load and crosstie supports [1].\n",

    "\n",
    "The gauges are arranged in a single Wheatstone bridge configuration which eliminates the effects of lateral load (crosstalk) on the induced strains and which outputs the difference in shear strain between locations A and B (see Figure 1). Differential shear is then directly proportional to the change in shear force caused by the applied load allowing for the determination of the applied load magnitude.  A similar configuration is used for the lateral circuit. However in the lateral circuit, the gauges are installed on the rail foot. The lateral load circuit uses the same principle of differential shear and a Wheatstone bridge circuit to eliminate the impact of the strains due to vertical loads. These methods were first presented by Ahlbeck et al. [2] and are still in wide use today. Though Ahlbeck et al. [2] presented a different variation of the lateral circuit described here, current lateral circuits are variants of the vertical load circuit presented in their report.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary functions of these circuits and the Wheatstone bridge configuration is to eliminate crosstalk so that the vertical and lateral loads can be measured independently. From the very initial days of wheel load measurement using strain gauges, the Wheatstone bridge has typically been incorporated into wheel load circuits and consequently the nature of crosstalk between vertical and lateral load-induced strains is relatively unknown. While engaged in a larger investigation into strain gauge-based wheel load measurements, different factors that impact these measurements, and the applicability of differential shear circuits in monitoring crosstie support conditions; it was observed that from a theoretical point of view, both lateral and vertical loads can be estimated from a linear combination of the eight (8) strains measured in the vertical load circuit. This study takes that theoretical observation and tests whether or not it is possible to measure both vertical and lateral load with a single vertical load circuit. If successful, the installation of wheel load detection circuits could be improved by halving the number of strain gauges and circuits required. In addition, a better understanding of the nature of the crosstalk between vertical and lateral load-induced strains could provide insight into other relationships such as the interdependence of strain measurements on rail contact position. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different methods have been identified that can successfully decouple wheel loads into their vertical and lateral components. One recent example of this was presented by Cortis et al. [3]. Building on the work of Moreau [4], Cortis et al. [3] proposed a new technique using rail bending strain to decouple vertical and lateral load components. It was found that this technique was able to accurately determine both vertical and lateral load with an error of less than 10% in a laboratory bench study. This approach certainly has merit and may represent the future of wheel load detection technology. However, it is hoped that a more open search, free of theoretical underpinnings (e.g. beam theory), may uncover other useful relationships which can increase the functionality of wheel load detection circuits. One potential example of this, as stated previously, could be the determination of contact position based on strain gauge measurements. Current efforts to investigate whether such relationships can be established are ongoing.\n",

    "## Data & Methods\n",
    "The primary objective of this research effort was to investigate the nature of vertical and lateral load crosstalk in differential shear circuits, and to find a quantitative relationship between the strains measured in the vertical load circuit and both vertical and lateral loads. As the Wheatstone bridge circuit is configured to eliminate such crosstalk, bridge behavior was not modeled in this effort. Instead, all eight (8) strain measurements are measured individually in a simple numerical parametric study. A simply supported section of AREMA 132RE rail was modeled using the FEM software ABAQUS® as shown in   Figure 2. \n",

    "\n",
    "The model used in the study was 1-m long, and was centrally loaded with meshed combinations of vertical and lateral loads. A vertical point load was applied at the center of the rail crown, and a lateral point load was applied at the lower tangent of the crown fillet. The load combinations consisted of vertical and lateral loads ranging from 0 to 250 kN in increments of 10 kN resulting in a total of 625 simulations.  Virtual strain gauges were placed at the neutral axis of the rail section at the longitudinal quarter points on both faces of the rail web. The virtual strain gauge comprised a 4 mm x 4 mm square element with a diagonal length (gauge length) of 5.7 mm.  The type of element chosen for this model was the ABAQUS® 3D8I element which is a linear hexahedral element with additional internal degrees of freedom to reduce parasitic shear and artificial stiffening due to bending [5]. The nodal mesh was assigned a global size of 5 mm, and this configuration resulted in nearly cubical elements within the web of the rail. The properties used to define the model are summarized in Table 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](.\\Table1.JPG)\n",
    " </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodal displacements for each simulation were used to calculate the infinitesimal strain for virtual strain gauges defined by the diagonal surface nodes of the gauge element.  Based on prior observation, it was known that vertical and lateral loads could be accurately determined from a linear combination of the shear strain values output by the FEM model. However, as these values are theoretical in-plane values only, it was unclear as to whether this observation would hold for a physical strain gauge. As previously shown by Rabbi et al., [1], the loads estimated from the in-plane component of shear strain can accurately establish the vertical load magnitude independent of the lateral load magnitude. However, when using nodal displacements to estimate the 3D strain behavior of a physical gauge, increasing lateral load causes an increase in the error of vertical circuit load measurements. This behavior suggests an interdependence between vertical and lateral load that may or may not be linear. Therefore, a linear regression of the eight (8) strain measurements for each simulation was conducted to ascertain whether or not a linear relationship can be found to relate the strain measurements of the vertical load circuit to vertical and lateral load magnitudes.\n",

    "Sci-kit learn is a python package that contains a number of machine learning tools including linear regression functions. The objective here is to find linear relationships so the 'sklearn.linear_model.fit()' method could be used to conduct a regression analysis. By passing the last eight (8) columns of the tr_data array as the first argument of the fit() method, and the first column (vertical) or the second column (lateral) as the second argument, a set of linear paramaters can be found along with the coefficient of multiple determination. However, due to a lack of familiarity with the machine learning approach in python and an understanding gap with some of the parameters and functionality of the linear_model, I have conducted the linear regression analysis in MatLab. As this is a small section of code compared to the overall task, I figured this reliance on known syntax is acceptable to assure that I obtain accurate results. I have copied the MatLab code I used here for reference:\n",

    "A linear regression analysis of the relationship between the applied vertical load and the strain measurements of the vertical load circuit shows that the relationship is indeed linear. Furthermore, the coefficient of multiple determination is unity meaning the vertical load can be precisely determined from the strain gauge outputs of the vertical load circuit. \n",

    "This matches the aforementioned observation showing that a linear combination of strain gauge measurements can be found which provides the same behavior as the Wheatstone bridge: effectively eliminating crosstalk between vertical and lateral load. The following equation precisely calculates the vertical load independent of lateral load (with zero error, or ϵ=0):\n",

    "A similar linear regression analysis for the relationship between lateral load and vertical circuit strain measurements shows a slightly more complicated relationship. The lateral load estimated from the strain measurements was found to be dependent on both lateral and vertical load magnitudes. For any given vertical load, a linear combination of vertical circuit strain gauge measurements can be found which will precisely calculate the lateral load. Therefore, the required relationship must also account for the ‘interactions’ between vertical load and strain measurements. This is done through a linear regression analysis which incorporates two-way interaction terms as shown below:\n",

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "This notebook presents findings from an ongoing research effort aimed at discovering relationships between the strains measured in a vertical wheel load detection circuit and the applied vertical and lateral loads. To investigate the nature of the interdependence (crosstalk) between vertical loads, lateral loads and strain gauge measurements, the Wheatstone bridge circuit was removed and individual strain gauge measurements were analyzed. A parametric study of 625 load combinations of vertical and lateral load, ranging between 0 and 250 kN, was conducted on a simply supported section of AREMA 132RE rail. The induced strains from each simulation were used in a linear regression analysis to find a quantitative relationship between wheel-load induced strains and the corresponding magnitude of vertical and lateral load. It was found that a linear combination, including two-way interaction terms, of the eight (8) strain gauge signals in a typical vertical wheel load circuit was able to accurately determine both the vertical and lateral load when the load position remains laterally and longitudinally constant. Additional work is required to verify if the method presented here is viable for field implementation or not. Current research efforts are aimed at finding an additional relationship to account for the longitudinal position of the applied load. If successful, typical vertical circuit gauge configurations can be used (sans the Wheatstone bridge) to simultaneously determine the vertical load, lateral load, and wheel load contact position, providing a time-history of wheel load as it passes through the circuit.\n",
